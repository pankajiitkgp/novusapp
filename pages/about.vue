                Novus Arc Design was established on July 05, 2012, as an
                architectural and interior design studio, specializing in green,
                sustainable and vernacular architecture. Based in Bhubaneswar,
                Odisha. With a lot of clients across the land of temples,
                especially in the western and southern parts, we have back
                offices in Bargarh and Rayagada as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The studio is shepherd by a young and seasoned architect of
                Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra –<span>
                  Ar. Abhinav Kaushal</span
                >. The studio comprises of people from varied interest like 5
                different fingers of a hand; and the trio proficiently leads the
                team like a fist. We take work as our passion, studio as our
                home and employees as our family.
              </p>

                <span>"We love to think. We live to create"</span> – is the
                motto of our firm. Challenging the orthodox methods and adapting
                the sustainable process with the application of basic sciences
                has been the driving force of the studio. We stand out for our
                practices in exposed brickwork, filler slabs, sustainable
                architecture and bamboo construction. We ensure sound,
                sustainable and cost–effective designs throughout a building's
                lifespan – from birth to rebirth. We prefer to spend our grey
                matter on design than our pocket on materials. The studio is
                absorbed in an architectural gamut in India. From residences to
                townships, educational institutes to commercial spaces, from
                recreational buildings to meditation centers, the studio is
                gradually getting magnified in the Indian market.
